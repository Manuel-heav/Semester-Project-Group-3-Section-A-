# Hotel Room Reservation System

This C++ program implements a simple Hotel Room Reservation System. This was a semester project
given in 2024 for Section A, Group 3 Students. It allows guests to book rooms in three categories: Ocean View Suite, Poolside Villa, and Garden View Room. The program prevents assigning the same room to multiple guests and prompts for alternative room choices if a category is fully booked.

## Features:

- User-friendly interface for room selection and booking.
- Error handling for invalid inputs (non-numeric or out-of-range selections).
- Display of current reserved room status for hotel staff.
- Patron search based on names for future reservations.

## Usage:

1. Run the program.
2. Select the desired room type (1, 2, or 3).
3. Choose a room number within the specified range.
4. Provide guest details (name, gender, age, and unique reservation code).
5. View the reservation confirmation and available rooms.
6. Optionally, search for patrons based on their names.

**Note:** The program uses arrays to manage room status, guest details, and reservation codes. The main loop allows users to book multiple rooms.

### Compilation:

- Ensure a C++ compiler is installed.
- Compile the program using: `g++ -o hotel_reservation assignment.cpp`
- Execute it as: `./hotel_reservation`

- The program prints a pattern based on the number entered.

## Usage:

1. Run the program.
2. Select the desired number between 0 - 9.

**Note:** The program uses loops to print the pattern.

### Compilation:
